# Software_Defects


different methods to detect defects in software code in NASA instruments. the data in SWDETECTS contains models that were evaluated “true” and “false” in terms of defects. 
This Project analysis the methods used to detect defects within NASA software code. Four methods were used including lines of code, cycloclamatic complexity, Essential Complexity, and Design Complexity. the methods were analyzed using probabilities for accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate, and precision. the most effective of the methods showed to be lines of code
